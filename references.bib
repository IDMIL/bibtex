    based on various matrix manipulations such as Single Value Decomposition.
    The FTM and MnM libraries are freely available.},

    Abstract = {{Though musicians rely primarily on their sense of hearing to monitor
    and adjust the sound being produced by their instrument, there exists
    a second path through which valuable information about the instrument's
    behavior can be observed - namely the feedback received via the haptic
    senses, the senses of touch and kinesthesia. The present study tested
    the hypothesis that leveraging off the musician's unconscious use
    of combined auditory and haptic cues by adding haptic feedback to
    computer-based musical instruments would improve the "playability"
    of these instruments. Twenty experienced musicians played a series
    of short melodies on an unfamiliar computer-based musical instrument.
    The instrument's controller was capable of producing force feedback,
    making it possible to systematically vary the instrument's "feel."
    Results indicate that the presence of haptic feedback improved playing
    accuracy by approximately 23 percent.}},

    Abstract = {A virtual reality surgical simulator ideally allows seamless transition
    between the real and virtual world. In that respect, all of a surgeon's
    motions and tools must be simulated. Until now researchers have been
    limited to using a pen-like tool in six degrees-of-freedom. This
    paper presents the addition of haptically enabled scissors to the
    end effector of a 6-DOF haptic device, the Freedom 6S. The scissors
    are capable of pinching a maximum torque of 460 mN.m with low inertia
    and low back-drive friction. The device is a balanced design so that
    the user feels like they are holding no more than actual scissors,
    although with some added inertia on the load end. The system is interchangeable
    between the 6-DOF and 7-DOF configurations to allow switching tools
    quickly.},

    a velocity source, and a torque controlled clutch, lead to a simple
    mechanism offering more control modes and lower power consumption
    than previous hybrid actuators. A haptic knob is designed and realized
    to test this approach. It includes a differential gear that allows
    the powder brake to mimic the behavior of a clutch. Haptic effects
    such as springs or walls have been implemented and successfully tested

    abstract = {Surgical simulation can provide great benefits to medicine by reducing
    the cost and duration of training and making the process more intuitive

    on the human-machine interface. A sense of touch greatly enhances
    the simulation experience, since much of the skill that a medical
    professional possesses is in his ability to explore and diagnose
    by touch. This sensory input can be provided by an input device with
    force and/or tactile feedback. There are many technical challenges
    associated with the creation of a robust surgical-simulation system
    incorporating touch feedback. The medical application has unique
    needs that drive the design of the mechanism, the control scheme,
    the tissue deformation engine, and the overall system architecture
    and distribution of computation. This technology is not yet mature;
    several companies are dedicated to creating various parts of a simulation
    system, but as yet there are no commercially available solutions
    that are cost effective. Interest in force-feedback devices is gaining
    momentum in the commercial sector however, notably in the area of
    personal computer games. The authors believe this interest will drive

    abstract = {BACKGROUND: The advantages of surgical robots and manipulators are
    well recognized in the clinical and technical community. Precision,
    accuracy and the potential for telesurgery are the prime motivations
    in applying advanced robot technology in surgery. In this paper critical
    interactions between Magnetic Resonance Imaging equipment and mechatronic
    devices are discussed and a novel Magnetic Resonance compatible surgical
    robot is described. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Experimental results of
    the effects from several passive (metallic materials) and active
    (ultrasound motors) mechanical elements are demonstrated. The design
    principles for Magnetic Resonance compatible robots are established
    and the compatibility of the proposed robot is assessed by comparing
    images taken with and without the robot's presence within Signa SP/I
    GE Medical Systems scanner. RESULTS: The results showed that, in
    principle, it is possible to construct precision mechatronic devices
    intended to operate inside MR scanner. Use of such a device will
    not cause image shift or significant degradation of signal-to-noise-ratio.
    An MR compatible surgical assist robot was designed and constructed.
    The robot is not affected by the presence of strong magnetic fields
    and is able to manoeuvre during imaging without compromising the
    quality of images. A novel image-guided robot control scheme was
    proposed. As a part of the control scheme, biomechanics-based organ
    deformation model was constructed and validated by in-vivo experiment.
    It has been recognised that for robust control of an image guided
    surgical robot the precise knowledge of the mechanical properties
    of soft organs operated on must be known. As an illustration, results
    in mathematical modelling and computer simulation of brain deformation
    are given. CONCLUSION: The novel MR compatible robot was designed
    to position and direct an axisymmetric tool, such as a laser pointer
    or a biopsy catheter. New Robot control system based on the prediction
    of soft organ deformation was proposed.},

    were acquired concurrently every 1 s. Activated voxels, identified
    by correlation with an empirically derived reference waveform, were
    found for both groups in cortex along the calcarine sulcus and in
    the fusiform gyrus, with the mean HDR latency in calcarine cortex
    peaking approximately 300 ms earlier than the HDR evoked in the fusiform

    as older subjects. The mean HDR had a similar onset time, rate of
    rise, and peak amplitude in both groups. However, the HDRs of older
    subjects reached their peak earlier and were more variable across
    subjects. Despite having average HDR amplitudes similar to those
    of younger subjects, older subjects had higher noise levels in activated

    of voxel statistics (t value, peak amplitude, peak latency) revealed
    that older subjects had proportionally fewer small-effect-size voxels,

    with the smaller spatial extent of activation in older subjects.
    To investigate age differences in the refractory period of the visual

    The device consists of four major subsystems: a) the electro-rheological

    d) the sensors: one optical encoder and one force sensor attached
    to the ERF resistive element's shaft to measure the patient induced

    use of electro theological fluids (ERF) to achieve resistive force
    generation. ERFs are fluids that experience dramatic changes in rheological
    properties, such as viscosity or yield stress, in the presence of
    an electric field. Using the electrically controlled rheological
    properties of ERFs, compact resistive elements with an ability to
    supply high resistive torques in a controllable and tunable fashion,
    have been developed. Our preliminary tests demonstrate that the device
    can apply, on a human hand holding the device handles, resistive
    forces that exceed 150 N. In addition the activated ERF maintain
    its properties in the magnetic environment without creating degradation

    techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
    Toward these applications, in this study we designed and validated
    an fMRI-compatible data glove with a built-in vibratory stimulus
    device for tactile feedback during VR experiments. A simple VR-fMRI
    experiment was performed at 3.0 Tesla on four young healthy adults

    The usefulness of the data glove was subsequently assessed using
    a series of questionnaires, behavioral performance, and the resulting
    activation images. Questionnaire scores indicated positive opinions
    with respect to the data glove, the tactile feedback, and the experimental
    paradigm. All subjects felt comfortable in the scanner during the
    VR experiment and were able to perform all aspects of the tasks successfully
    and with reasonable accuracy. In addition, activation maps showed
    the anticipated modulations in motor, somatosensory, and parietal

    of over-learned musical sequences) was consistently characterized
    by a dissociated pattern of activity in the prefrontal cortex: extensive
    deactivation of dorsolateral prefrontal and lateral orbital regions
    with focal activation of the medial prefrontal (frontal polar) cortex.
    Such a pattern may reflect a combination of psychological processes
    required for spontaneous improvisation, in which internally motivated,
    stimulus-independent behaviors unfold in the absence of central processes
    that typically mediate self-monitoring and conscious volitional control
    of ongoing performance. Changes in prefrontal activity during improvisation
    were accompanied by widespread activation of neocortical sensorimotor
    areas (that mediate the organization and execution of musical performance)
    as well as deactivation of limbic structures (that regulate motivation
    and emotional tone). This distributed neural pattern may provide
    a cognitive context that enables the emergence of spontaneous creative
    activity. },

    during actual and imagined performance of Mozart’s violin concerto

    in G major (KV216). Execution and imagination of (left hand) fingering
    movements of the first 16 bars of the concerto were performed.

    Electromyography (EMG) feedback was used during imagery training to
    avoid actual movement execution and EMG recording was

    employed during the scanning of both executed and imagined musical
    performances. We observed that professional musicians generated

    higher EMG amplitudes during movement execution and showed focused
    cerebral activations in the contralateral primary sensorimotor

    cortex, the bilateral superior parietal lobes, and the ipsilateral
    anterior cerebellar hemisphere. The finding that professionals exhibited
    higher

    activity of the right primary auditory cortex during execution may
    reflect an increased strength of audio–motor associative connectivity.
    It

    appears that during execution of musical sequences in professionals,
    a higher economy of motor areas frees resources for increased

    connectivity between the finger sequences and auditory as well as
    somatosensory loops, which may account for the superior musical

    performance. Professionals also demonstrated more focused activation
    patterns during imagined musical performance. However, the

    auditory–motor loop was not involved during imagined performances
    in either musician group. It seems that the motor and auditory systems

    are coactivated as a consequence of musical training but only if one
    system (motor or auditory) becomes activated by actual movement

    execution or live musical auditory stimuli.},

    Whereas rapidly evolving changes of cortical motor representations
    were the subject of a number of recent studies, effects of long-term
    practice on the motor system are so far poorly understood. In the
    present study pianists and nonmusicians were investigated using functional
    magnetic resonance imaging. Both groups performed simple and complex
    movement sequences on a keyboard with the right hand, the tasks requiring
    different levels of ordinal complexity. The aim of this study was
    to characterize motor representations related to sequence complexity
    and to long-term motor practice. In nonmusicians, complex motor sequences
    showed higher fMRI activations of the presupplementary motor area
    (pre-SMA) and the rostral part of the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd)
    compared to simple motor sequences, whereas musicians showed no differential
    activations. These results may reflect the higher level of visuomotor
    integration required in the complex task in nonmusicians, whereas
    in musicians this rostral premotor network was employed during both
    tasks. Comparison of subject groups revealed increased activation
    of a more caudal premotor network in nonmusicians comprising the
    caudal part of the PMd and the supplementary motor area. This supports
    recent results suggesting a specialization within PMd. Furthermore,
    we conclude that plasticity due to long-term practice mainly occurs
    in caudal motor areas directly related to motor execution. The slowly
    evolving changes in M1 during motor skill learning may extend to
    adjacent areas, leading to more effective motor representations in
    pianists.},

    to perform minimally

    invasive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in the abdominal
    and thoracic

    cavities, with real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance
    inside clinical cylindrical

    MR scanners. The manipulator is composed of a three degree of freedom
    Cartesian

    motion system, which resides outside the gantry of the scanner, and
    serves as the

    holder and global positioner of a three degree of freedom arm which
    extends inside the

    gantry of the scanner. At its distal end, the arm’s end-effector can
    carry an interventional

    tool such as a biopsy needle, which can be advanced to a desired depth
    by means of a

    seventh degree of freedom. These seven degrees of freedom, provided
    by the entire assembly,

    offer extended manipulability to the device and a wide envelope of
    operation to

    the user, who can select a trajectory suitable for the procedure.
    The device is constructed

    of nonmagnetic and nonconductive fiberglass, and carbon fiber composite
    materials, to

    minimize artifacts and distortion on the MR images as well as eliminate
    effects on its

    operation from the high magnetic field and the fast switching magnetic
    field gradients

    used in MR imaging. A user interface was developed for man-in-the-loop
    control of the

    device using real-time MR images. The user interface fuses all sensor
    signals (MR and

    manipulator information) in a visualization, planning, and control
    command environment.

    Path planning is performed with graphical tools for setting the trajectory
    of insertion

    of the interventional tool using multislice and/or three dimensional
    MR images

    which are refreshed in real time. The device control is performed
    with an embedded

    computer which runs real-time control software. The manipulator compatibility
    with the

    MR environment and image-guided operation was tested on a 1.5 T MR
    scanner.},

    are presented that show the EPAM RMIC is completely compatible in

    abstract = {Abstract Most standard accounts of human anatomy and physiology are
    designed to meet the requirements of medical education and therefore
    consider their subject matter from the standpoint of typical rather
    than outstanding levels of performance. To understand how high levels
    of skill are developed and maintained, it is necessary to study elite
    groups such as professional athletes or musicians. This can lead
    to the rediscovery of arcane knowledge that has fallen into neglect
    through a lack of appreciation of its significance. For example,
    although variability in the muscles and tendons of the hand was well
    known in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it is through
    recent studies of musicians that its practical significance has become
    better appreciated. From even a cursory acquaintance with the training
    methods of sportsmen and women, dancers and musicians, it is clear
    that sophisticated motor skills are developed only at the cost of
    a great deal of time and effort. Over a lifetime of performance,
    musicians arguably spend more time in skill acquisition than almost
    any other group and offer a number of unique advantages for the study
    of motor control. Such intensive training not only modifies cortical
    maps but may even affect the gross morphology of the central nervous
    system. There is also evidence that in certain individuals this process
    can become maladaptive. Recent studies of musicians suggest that
    intensive training can lead to the appearance of ambiguities in the
    cortical somatosensory representation of the hand that may be associated
    with the development of focal dystonia; a condition to which musicians
    are particularly prone. The realization that changes in cortical
    maps may underlie dystonia has led to the development of new approaches
    to its treatment, which may ultimately benefit musicians and non-musicians
    alike.},

    theoretical calculations showed that the magnetic field generated

This choice is particularly difficult for robotic systems working within a magnetic resonance {(MR)} environment because of the safety and compatibility constraints imposed by the high magnetic field, switching gradients, electromagnetic pulses, and sensitive measuring equipment involved. This article analyzes actuation methods for robotic systems to be used within a magnetic resonance environment, such as systems for diagnostic and interventional {MRI,} neuroscience studies during functional {MRI,} and diagnostic {fMRI.} In the case of functional {MRI,} actuation is also required during imaging, whereas current {MR-compatible} interventional systems are typically moved between imaging phases. Our analysis is based on a variety of actuation principles that we have tested both for {MR} compatibility and for the quality of force feedback that can be realized, including hydrostatic, belt, and cable transmissions as well as electrostatic and piezoelectric actuators. The results are completed with developments of other groups. A good solution to a given application often involves a combination of several actuation principles. A synthesis of characteristics and three comparative tables aid in the choice of an adequate actuation method for a given task or application. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

may be used as a vibration, temperature or strain sensor, or simply as a musical instrument. Coating the optical fibre with
novel materials such as {PZLT} may well allow a modification of vibration properties to enhance, suppress certain harmonics
or lead to the development of simple electric field sensors.
